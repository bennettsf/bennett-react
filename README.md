### Welcome to my Personal Website Respository!
I plan to update this project frequently to share my journey in Computer Science/Application Development.
You can access the static version of the webpage here: https://bennettsf.github.io/bennettsf/

### Recent Changes/Additions
- Utilization of GitHubâ€™s API to create a dynamic list component of my recently updated repositories. 
- Implementation of Dark and Light mode of the site.
  
### In Progress:
- I am currently working on getting the page running on an AWS server so other features are available.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
